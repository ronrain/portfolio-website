        <h3>IBEW</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>
          Before going full-time in General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp, I worked for IBEW Local Union #3 as an electrician. I worked at multiple different locations, ranging from hospitals, project buildings, and hotels across the city. Being as an apprentice, I was not only tasked to assist my journeyman and learn the tricks of the trade and installing a number of different power and lighting systems, but I also led the weekly safety meetings. During the safety meetings, I led discussions about different and prevalent safety concerns such as ladder safety and ear protection. We would then discuss with the foreman any onsite safety issues that needed to be addressed so that we can complete our daily objectives safely.

          <p>
          During college, I worked for the Accept, Compete, Excel program, better known as ACE. It was affiliated with the Princeton YMCA and was funded through AmeriCorps - New Jersey Bonner program. The goal of ACE was to combat chronic absenteeism among high school and middle school students in the Princeton community through a mentorship program. My tenure was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced me to work remote but allowed me to get an optimal amount of work done. I was tasked with creating an original Microsoft Excel datasheet that would track the students' academics and attendance over time, as well as tracking the number of service hours among the students in our program. I led bi-weekly stakeholder meetings where I would address the leaders in the YMCA and New Jersey Bonner about the progress of our students and any events. I was in charge of contacting the students' mentors about their academic progress and events via Basecamp and email, as well as resolving any issues presented by the mentors.

        <p>
        While completing my master's degree, I was working with ACE. I used my time with ACE to complete my capstone project. My project focused on chronic absenteeism and methods to combat it among middle and high school students. My idea was to provide chronically absent students an alternate route other than college: trade schools. I surveyed the students' interests in tasks similar to a trade and wanted to see how their community benefited them and how their community can do better for them. I asked this to the students themselves and to their mentors. I then shared my findings with our stakeholders and mentors to have a proactive discussion on how the students can prosper after high school.

        <h3>Farmers Gainst hunger</h3>

        <p>
        During my senior year of my bachelor's, I volunteered with a program called Farmers Against Hunger. The goal of the program was to glean produce from farmers and supermarkets to then be distributed to the food-insecure population. I participated in gleanings and food distributions across New Jersey State. My capstone project allowed me to better get in touch with low-income and food-insecure communities across New Jersey. I created recipes with the food that would primarily be distributed to them at food drives. I also created informational pamphlets about the benefits of fruits and vegetables.
