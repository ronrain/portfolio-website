            Before embarking on a full-time journey into General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp, I gained valuable experience as an electrician at IBEW Local Union #3. This role took me to various work sites, including hospitals, construction projects, and hotels throughout the city.
            
            As an apprentice, my responsibilities extended beyond assisting my journeyman and learning the intricacies of electrical work. I also took on the role of leading weekly safety meetings. During these meetings, I facilitated discussions on important safety topics, such as ladder safety and the use of ear protection. We addressed and resolved any on-site safety concerns in collaboration with the foreman, ensuring that our daily tasks were completed safely and efficiently.

            During my college years, I was part of the Accept, Compete, Excel program, ACE, affiliated with the Princeton YMCA and funded by AmeriCorps - New Jersey Bonner program. ACE aimed to combat chronic absenteeism in Princeton's schools through mentorship during my tenure, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, where I worked remotely. My main task was creating a comprehensive Excel sheet to track students' academics, attendance, and service hours. I led stakeholder meetings to update the YMCA and New Jersey Bonner program leaders on our progress. I also communicated with students' mentors via Basecamp and email, addressing academic concerns and resolving mentor-related issues.

            While pursuing my master's degree, I collaborated with ACE on my capstone project, which focused on combatting chronic absenteeism among middle and high school students. I explored the possibility of offering chronically absent students an alternative path, such as trade schools, by surveying their interests in trade-related tasks. I also gathered insights from students and mentors on how their communities could better support them. I shared my findings with stakeholders and mentors to initiate discussions on improving students' prospects after high school.

            During my senior year of college, I volunteered with Farmers Against Hunger, a program focused on collecting surplus produce from farmers and supermarkets to distribute to those in need across New Jersey. As part of my capstone project, I created recipes using the donated food and informational pamphlets promoting the benefits of fruits and vegetables for low-income communities in the state.
