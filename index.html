      Before going fulltime in General Assemblys software engineering bootcamp, I worked for IBEW Local Union #3 as an electrician. I worked at multiple different locations, ranging from hospitals, project buildings and hotels across the city. Being as an apprentice, I was not only tasked to assist my journeyman and learn the tricks of the trade and installing a number of differnt power and lighting systems, I also led the weekly safety meetings. During the safety meetings, I led discussions about different and prevalent safety concerns such as ladder safety and ear protection. We would then discuss with the foreman any onsite safety issues that needed to be addressed so that we can complete our daily objectives safetly.

      During college, I worked for the Accept, Compete, Excel program, better known as ACE. It was affiliated with the Princeton YMCA and was funded through AmeriCorps - New Jersey Bonner program. The goal of ACE was to combat chronic absenteeism among high school and middle school students in the Princeton community through a mentorship program. I was tasked with creating an original Mircosoft Excel datasheet that would track the students academics and attendance over time, as well as tracking the number of service hours among the students in our program. I led bi-weekly stakeholder meetings where I would address the leaders in the YMCA and New Jersey Bonner about the progress of our students and any events. I was in charge of contacting the students' mentors about their academic progress and events via Basecamp and email, as well as resolving any issues presented by the mentors.
